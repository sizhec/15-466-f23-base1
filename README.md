How Your Asset Pipeline Works:

I created a function given tile table index and palette table index which scan through the png data array and fill in corresponding  
tile table and palette table. Then create sprites using these indexes.


How To Play:

W, A, S, D for movement.

Space to send out your Poke Balls!


This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
